# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is a terraform module that creates a lambda function that rotates SSH keys
  on EC2 instances via AWS Secrets Manager.

introduction: |-

  This module is based off the AWS example:

    * [How to use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and rotate SSH key pairs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-aws-secrets-manager-securely-store-rotate-ssh-key-pairs/)

  The original source is from
  [aws-samples/aws-secrets-manager-ssh-key-rotation](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-secrets-manager-ssh-key-rotation)
  and it is (C) Amazon and licensed under MIT-0.


# How to use this project
usage: |-

  Note that `master` is used in the examples, but you should instead pin to the latest tag.

  ```hcl
  module "rotate_ssh" {
    source          = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-lambda-secrets-manager-ssh-key-rotation.git?ref=master"

    namespace       = var.namespace
    name            = var.name
    stage           = var.stage
    delimiter       = var.delimiter
    attributes      = ["ssh-key-rotate"]
    tags            = var.tags
    server_username = "admin"
    tag_name        = "RotateSSHKeys"
    tag_value       = "true"
  }
  ```
